# This is the URL of the git repo folder that contains the config, pickles, and last-updated folders.
# It should be a raw path with which the file can be directly downloaded. If installing through the
# Concourse pipeline, this value will be overridden.
# Example:
# repositoryPath: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vbrunsch/rankings/main/visualizations
repositoryPath:

# This is the list of regions that will be deployed. The 'path' value is required and should correspond directly to
# the name of the visualization configuration YAML files. If you wish to integrate your visualizations with the
# home page, you need to add the 'name' and 'fake' values (default: false), as shown below. The 'name' value
# allows you to set the exact display name for your region and the 'fake' value must be used to indicate when
# a region does not have a visualization. This may occur, for example, if you have visualizations for some cities
# and you represent them as subregions of a state, but you do not have a visualization for that state.
# Example:
# regions:
#   - name: Germany
#     path: germany
#   - name: Saxony
#     path: germany/saxony

# This is the list of origins that will be allowed to connect to the visualization server. Any domains used
# to view the visualizations should be listed here, otherwise the requests will be blocked.

# allowedOrigins:
#   - localhost
#   - nocovid.group
#   - ec19.org
#   - endcoronavirus.org
